# üìÖ Week 7 ‚Äì CSIS 2260 (Operating Systems) ‚Äì Survey Week with Practice

## **Day 4 ‚Äì Processor Management & Scheduling**

### üîç Concepts

- **CPU Scheduling Goals**:
  - Maximize CPU utilization
  - Minimize waiting time
  - Provide fairness among processes
- **Common Scheduling Algorithms**:
  - **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** ‚Äì Non-preemptive, simple queue.
  - **Shortest Job First (SJF)** ‚Äì Runs process with the smallest CPU burst next.
  - **Round Robin (RR)** ‚Äì Preemptive, each process gets a fixed time quantum.
- **Context Switching**:
  - Saving the state of the current process and loading the state of the next process.

### üìñ Theory Notes

- **FCFS**:
  - Pros: Simple
  - Cons: Can cause ‚Äúconvoy effect‚Äù
- **SJF**:
  - Pros: Minimizes average waiting time
  - Cons: Requires knowing the CPU burst time in advance
- **RR**:
  - Pros: Fair time allocation
  - Cons: Too small quantum ‚Üí overhead; Too large quantum ‚Üí behaves like FCFS

### ‚úçÔ∏è Pseudocode Test (Round Robin)

```
WHILE processes remain
  SELECT next process in queue
  EXECUTE for time quantum
  IF process finished THEN remove
  ELSE add to end of queue
ENDWHILE
```

### üß™ Code Simulation (Python Example)

```python
from collections import deque

processes = deque([
    {"name": "P1", "time": 5},
    {"name": "P2", "time": 3},
    {"name": "P3", "time": 8}
])

time_quantum = 2

while processes:
    process = processes.popleft()
    print(f"Running {process['name']} for {min(time_quantum, process['time'])} units")
    process['time'] -= time_quantum
    if process['time'] > 0:
        processes.append(process)
```

---

### üß™ Code Simulation (JavaScript Example)

```js
let processes = [
  { name: "P1", time: 5 },
  { name: "P2", time: 3 },
  { name: "P3", time: 8 }
];
const timeQuantum = 2;

while (processes.length > 0) {
  let process = processes.shift();
  console.log(`Running ${process.name} for ${Math.min(timeQuantum, process.time)} units`);
  process.time -= timeQuantum;
  if (process.time > 0) {
    processes.push(process);
  }
}
```

---

### üß™ Code Simulation (C# Example)

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var processes = new Queue<(string Name, int Time)>(new[]
        {
            ("P1", 5),
            ("P2", 3),
            ("P3", 8)
        });

        int timeQuantum = 2;

        while (processes.Count > 0)
        {
            var process = processes.Dequeue();
            int runTime = Math.Min(timeQuantum, process.Time);
            Console.WriteLine($"Running {process.Name} for {runTime} units");
            int remaining = process.Time - timeQuantum;
            if (remaining > 0)
            {
                processes.Enqueue((process.Name, remaining));
            }
        }
    }
}
```
