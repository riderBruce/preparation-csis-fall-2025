# üìÖ Week 7 ‚Äì CSIS 2260 (Operating Systems) ‚Äì Survey Week with Practice

## **Day 1 ‚Äì Hardware & System Overview**

### üîç Concepts

- CPU, memory, storage, I/O devices
- Microprocessor architecture: ALU, control unit, registers
- Instruction cycle: fetch ‚Üí decode ‚Üí execute ‚Üí store

### üìñ Theory Notes

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: Brain of the computer; executes instructions.
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Performs arithmetic (+, -, \*, /) and logic (AND, OR, NOT) operations.
- **Control Unit (CU)**: Directs data flow between CPU, memory, and peripherals.
- **Registers**: Small, fast storage locations inside the CPU.
- **Instruction Cycle**:
  1. **Fetch** ‚Äì Retrieve instruction from memory.
  2. **Decode** ‚Äì Determine the operation and required data.
  3. **Execute** ‚Äì Perform the operation.
  4. **Store** ‚Äì Save the result.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Pseudocode Test

```
START
  LOAD instruction from memory
  DECODE instruction
  EXECUTE instruction
  STORE result
REPEAT until program ends
END
```

---

### üß™ Code Simulation (Python Example)

```python
instructions = ["ADD 2 3", "MUL 4 5", "SUB 10 7"]

def execute(instruction):
    parts = instruction.split()
    op, a, b = parts[0], int(parts[1]), int(parts[2])
    if op == "ADD":
        return a + b
    elif op == "SUB":
        return a - b
    elif op == "MUL":
        return a * b

for instr in instructions:
    print(f"FETCH: {instr}")
    print("DECODE")
    result = execute(instr)
    print(f"EXECUTE ‚Üí result = {result}")
    print("STORE result in register\n")
```

## **Day 2 ‚Äì OS Introduction & Roles**

### üîç Concepts

- OS as a resource manager
- Types of OS: batch, time-sharing, distributed, real-time
- Popular OS families: Windows, Linux/Unix, Android

### üìñ Theory Notes

- **Operating System**: Software that manages hardware resources and provides services for application programs.
- **Core roles**:
  - **Resource Management**: CPU scheduling, memory allocation, I/O control.
  - **User Interface**: CLI (Command Line Interface) or GUI (Graphical User Interface).
  - **Security & Access Control**: Manages permissions.
- **Types of OS**:
  - **Batch** ‚Äì Processes jobs in batches without user interaction.
  - **Time-sharing** ‚Äì Allows multiple users to share system resources simultaneously.
  - **Distributed** ‚Äì Multiple computers working together as one.
  - **Real-time** ‚Äì Guarantees response within a strict time limit.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Pseudocode Test

```
IF resource request
  CHECK availability
  IF available THEN allocate
  ELSE wait
ENDIF
```

---

### üß™ Code Simulation (Python Example)

```python
resources = {"CPU": 1, "Printer": 1}
requests = ["CPU", "Printer", "CPU"]

for req in requests:
    print(f"Requesting {req}...")
    if resources.get(req, 0) > 0:
        resources[req] -= 1
        print(f"Allocated {req}")
    else:
        print(f"{req} not available, waiting...")
```

### ‚ùì Quiz

1. Name 3 types of operating systems.
2. Which OS type is best for air-traffic control?
