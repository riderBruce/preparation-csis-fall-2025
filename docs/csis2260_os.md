This course introduces the major components of operating systems, such as memory management, processor management, process management and file management. Emphasis will be placed on system performance under different design alternatives. Some popular operating systems, such as Windows, Unix/Linux, and Android may be used to illustrate their implementations. Students are required to work on at least two operating systems. This course is suitable for students who wish to learn more about the operating system process under different system environments, such as mobile, desktop and server environments. This course may involve group work.
