# CSIS 2200 - Week 04 Day 6

## üìå Topic: Data Modeling & System Components

### üß† Key Concepts to Learn

1. **System Components**

   - People
   - Hardware
   - Software
   - Data
   - Networks
     > These components work together to support the business.

2. **Data Modeling**

   - **Entity**: An object or concept (e.g., Customer, Product).
   - **Attribute**: A property of an entity (e.g., Name, Email).
   - **Relationship**: How entities are connected (e.g., A Customer places an Order).

3. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
   - A visual representation of data relationships.
   - Basic symbols: Rectangles (Entities), Ovals (Attributes), Diamonds (Relationships).

### üìò Study Prompt

- Watch: [ER Diagram Tutorial | Learn ERD step by step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpdhBUYk7Kk)

### üß™ Optional Coding Challenge

Let‚Äôs simulate an entity and relationship in JavaScript:

```javascript
const customer = {
  id: 101,
  name: "Alice",
  email: "alice@example.com",
};

const orders = [
  { orderId: 1, customerId: 101, item: "Keyboard" },
  { orderId: 2, customerId: 101, item: "Monitor" },
];

function getOrdersByCustomer(customerId) {
  return orders.filter((order) => order.customerId === customerId);
}

console.log(getOrdersByCustomer(customer.id));
```

### üí¨ Reflection Questions

1. Can you think of a real-world example where systems components (like people and software) worked together effectively?

- In combinient stores, customer can pay after scanning a barcord, then the payment system reads credit card for payment. Customer, scanner, and the system works together.

2. Have you ever seen an ER diagram before? Where or how?

- When I builded up a database, it was hard to know which property has to be a pk. I could see the theory about ERD at that time.

3. Why is it important to model data before building a system?

- It's a blueprint of database that store and retrive data. If the modeling is not fixed or modified, all system's outline should be fixed.

### üìù Mini Exercise

Draw a simple ERD (on paper or tool) for a Library System:

- Entities: Book, Member, Loan
- Attributes: (e.g., Book ‚Üí title, author)
- Relationships: A Member borrows a Book
