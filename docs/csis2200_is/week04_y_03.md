# CSIS 2200 - Day 3

Topic: The Value of Information & Information Systems in Organizations

## Key Concepts

1. Value of Information (VOI)

   - Information only has value if it helps someone make a decision or take action.
   - The value increases when information:
     - Reduces uncertainty
     - Supports strategic decision-making
     - Improves efficiency or productivity

2. Information Quality Dimensions

   - Accuracy – Is the data correct?
   - Timeliness – Is it up-to-date?
   - Relevance – Does it help the user?
   - Completeness – Is anything missing?
   - Consistency – Does it match other data?

3. Alignment with Organizational Strategy

   - IT should not exist just for technology’s sake.
   - Information Systems (IS) must support:
     - Business goals
     - Competitive advantage
     - Core processes

4. Business Process Improvement (BPI)

   - Information systems can improve:
     - Cost reduction
     - Time savings
     - Workflow automation
     - Decision-making
     - Example tools: ERP, CRM, BI dashboards

5. Ethical Use of Information

   - Must ensure:
     - Privacy is protected (e.g., customer data)
     - Data is used for intended purpose only
     - Transparent communication about usage

## Reflection Questions

1. **Can you think of a time when good information helped you make a better decision?**  
   Every time I buy something, I try to find reviews to get accurate information. It really reduces trial and error. This habit has saved me a lot of time and allowed me to do other valuable things.

2. **Have you ever worked at a company where the information system wasn’t aligned with the business needs? What happened?**  
   I worked in a construction company that built large infrastructure, factories, and buildings. The company had a lot of trial and error that could have been helpful to other projects. However, due to the need to keep project details confidential—such as negotiation outcomes and value engineering deals—crucial information had to be deleted on purpose. Eventually, the information system wasn’t aligned with the business needs. Only the information that wasn’t closely tied to the core business was reta...

3. **How do you evaluate if a report or dashboard is trustworthy?**  
   I compare my own knowledge with the report or dashboard, especially the peripheral parts of the information. The main points of view can be controlled by the writer or administrator, but the surrounding context is harder to manipulate intentionally.

## Optional Practice

- **Watch this YouTube video: “What Is the Value of Information?”**  
  I watched a lot of videos about VOI. Many of them explain how to calculate the value of information.

- **Try writing 3 real-life situations where quality information changed an outcome (personal or professional):**  
  1. For driving, I use a navigation app so I don’t get lost and can save my precious time.  
  2. I love to study maps before traveling to a new area. This habit makes my friends think I’m trustworthy with geographical information.  
  3. When my wife and I visited Seattle’s baseball park, I knew in advance how expensive the parking fee was. I even booked a parking spot beforehand, which made it easier to access the stadium.

- **Review your favorite app or website: How does it display or use information? Is it valuable to you?**  
  My favorite app is YouTube. It displays my favorite videos first. It knows what I watched, liked, and clicked on, so it can recommend content I’m likely to enjoy.
