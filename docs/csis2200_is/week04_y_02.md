## 🧠 Reflection Prompt (Optional Journal)

### What kinds of decisions do you make based on information in your life?

    - Whenever I buy something, I make a checklist and gather all the necessary information. That habit helps me make more insightful decisions.
    - When I worked in the Risk Management Department, every risk had to be quantified. Those numbers provided valuable insights to the management and gave them confidence in their decision-making.

### Have you ever used a dashboard before (in school, work, or an app)?

    - When I was a junior employee at Hyundai, I had to prepare reports for the Human Resource Assessment Program. That system had a large dashboard on the main page. While it looked great, the management often preferred to see exactly what they wanted rather than relying on data visualizations. That experience taught me that understanding people’s perspectives is often more important than just showing data.

### What tool would you like to explore for creating visual reports?

    - I’ve built dashboards both as web apps and in Windows Forms, but I prefer Excel-style dashboards. They’re easy to update and allow me to add key information with just one click.
