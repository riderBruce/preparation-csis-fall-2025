## 🧠 Core Concepts

### What is SDLC?

The **System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process for planning, developing, testing, and deploying information systems in a systematic way.

### 🔄 SDLC Phases

| Phase                 | Description                                                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Planning**       | Define the problem, set project goals, and identify scope.           |
| **2. Analysis**       | Gather and analyze requirements. Understand end-user needs.          |
| **3. Design**         | Create architectural and detailed design plans. Define system specs. |
| **4. Development**    | Actual coding or software creation.                                  |
| **5. Testing**        | Check for bugs, usability, performance, and reliability.             |
| **6. Implementation** | Deploy the system into production. Train users.                      |
| **7. Maintenance**    | Update, fix, and improve the system post-deployment.                 |

## 💡 Why SDLC Is Important

- Provides a **roadmap** for system building.
- Reduces **costly errors** and rework.
- Ensures **end-user needs** are met systematically.
- Helps ensure **quality and performance**.

## 🎯 Reflection Questions

1. Have you ever been part of a project (school or work) that followed a step-by-step process like SDLC? What did that look like?

    - Yes, I had been part of a project called BSC system working in planning office. Since I was a junior and didn't be used to all the process, I remember that the consulting firm mentioned water fall process. We build a plan and keep the timeline step by step. After finishing the all the interviews, we could proceed next step. It was delayed by management's simple comment.

2. Which phase do you think is most critical? Why?

    - I think design phase is most critical. On design phase, we can check finally real actual data for creating architectual design plan. Think that many employee - especially the management - believe that there is data and property if they are not actual clean data but only modified for certain reason. At that time, the project have to change their plan from the start. I experienced a lot of cases that after big plan but action not been followed because insufficient detail data checking. Only clean data can be handled by programs automatically. Overall checking the needed data format is critical and that process is done at design phase.

3. What might happen if a team skips the testing or planning phase?

    - When we build a project, it occurs lots of judgement or choices. We need the plan for the selection and we can lost the way without it. Without testing, most project faced many problems that could not expected. At testing phase, it make a possible sinarios to reduce possibility of errors. After testing, the system can be reliable for the users with minimum errors.

## 🔁 SDLC vs Agile – Comparison Table

| SDLC (Waterfall)       | Agile                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Sequential steps       | Iterative and incremental |
| Detailed documentation | Lightweight documentation |
| Longer release cycle   | Short, frequent releases  |
| Rigid once planned     | Flexible and adaptive     |

## 🛠 Optional Practice

> **Draw your own SDLC diagram** using paper or [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/),  
> and describe each phase using a project you can imagine (e.g., a to-do list app).
