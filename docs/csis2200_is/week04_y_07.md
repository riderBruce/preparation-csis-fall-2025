## 🧠 Core Concepts

### What is SDLC?

The **System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process for planning, developing, testing, and deploying information systems in a systematic way.

### 🔄 SDLC Phases

| Phase                 | Description                                                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Planning**       | Define the problem, set project goals, and identify scope.           |
| **2. Analysis**       | Gather and analyze requirements. Understand end-user needs.          |
| **3. Design**         | Create architectural and detailed design plans. Define system specs. |
| **4. Development**    | Actual coding or software creation.                                  |
| **5. Testing**        | Check for bugs, usability, performance, and reliability.             |
| **6. Implementation** | Deploy the system into production. Train users.                      |
| **7. Maintenance**    | Update, fix, and improve the system post-deployment.                 |

## 💡 Why SDLC Is Important

- Provides a **roadmap** for system building.
- Reduces **costly errors** and rework.
- Ensures **end-user needs** are met systematically.
- Helps ensure **quality and performance**.

## 🎯 Reflection Questions

1. Have you ever been part of a project (school or work) that followed a step-by-step process like SDLC? What did that look like?
2. Which phase do you think is most critical? Why?
3. What might happen if a team skips the testing or planning phase?

## 🔁 SDLC vs Agile – Comparison Table

| SDLC (Waterfall)       | Agile                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Sequential steps       | Iterative and incremental |
| Detailed documentation | Lightweight documentation |
| Longer release cycle   | Short, frequent releases  |
| Rigid once planned     | Flexible and adaptive     |

## 🛠 Optional Practice

> **Draw your own SDLC diagram** using paper or [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/),  
> and describe each phase using a project you can imagine (e.g., a to-do list app).
