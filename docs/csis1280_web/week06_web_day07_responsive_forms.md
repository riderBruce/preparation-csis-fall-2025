### ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- **Responsiveness**:

  - Use `flexbox` or `grid` for layout
  - Use relative widths like `width: 100%`, `max-width`, `min-width`
  - Use media queries for mobile breakpoint (e.g., `max-width: 600px`)

- **Accessibility**:
  - Always use `<label for="id">` for inputs
  - Use `aria-label` or `aria-describedby` where needed
  - Ensure focus is visible (`:focus` styles)
