### ðŸ“˜ Key Concepts

| Attribute    | Meaning                                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Accuracy     | Is the information correct and reliable?           |

### ðŸ”Ž Real-World Reflection

1. Have you ever made a bad decision because of missing or wrong information?
2. What are some examples in business where poor data quality caused problems?
3. Think about one system (an app, a report, or a dashboard) you use â€” how would you improve the **quality of its information**?

### ðŸ§  Activity â€“ Evaluate Information Quality

Pick one example (a news article, dashboard, or a spreadsheet youâ€™ve used) and answer:

- Is the data **complete**?
- Is it **accurate** and **up-to-date**?
- Can you **verify the source**?
- Does it help you make a clear decision?

### ðŸ’» Bonus Coding (Optional)

Letâ€™s simulate a quality check with some basic JavaScript:

```js
const data = {
  name: "Customer A",
  address: "",
  email: "customer@example.com",
  date: "2023-01-01",
};

function checkQuality(data) {
  const issues = [];
  if (!data.name) issues.push("Missing name");
  if (!data.address) issues.push("Missing address");
  const outdated = new Date(data.date) < new Date("2024-01-01");
  if (outdated) issues.push("Outdated information");

  return issues.length > 0 ? issues : ["Data looks good!"];
}

console.log(checkQuality(data));
```
