# 📅 Day 2: Processes and Threads (CSIS 2260 Preview)

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand the difference between a **process** and a **program**.
- Learn the various **states** of a process.
- Grasp the basics of **threads**, **multithreading**, and **multiprocessing**.
- Begin exploring real system process monitors (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## 📘 Topics to Cover

### ✅ Process vs Program

- A **program** is a passive set of instructions.
- A **process** is an active instance of a program in execution.
