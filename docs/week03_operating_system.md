# 📘 CSIS 2260 – One-Week Preview Plan (Operating Systems)

This preview plan is for Fall 2025 to help prepare for CSIS 2260: Operating Systems. It includes theory, practical activities, and curated video resources. The structure combines daily micro-goals with hands-on activities.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To get familiar with foundational Operating System concepts and practical knowledge needed to succeed in CSIS 2260.

## 📅 Weekly Breakdown

### **Day 1: Introduction to Operating Systems**

- 🔍 Concepts:
  - What is an Operating System?
  - Roles and responsibilities (resource manager, interface, scheduler)
  - Types of OS: Batch, Time-sharing, Distributed, Real-time
- ▶️ Watch:
  - CrashCourse OS Episodes 1 & 2
- ✍️ Do:
  - Take notes on different types of OS with examples.
  - Journal entry: “Why do we need operating systems?”

---

### **Day 2: Processes and Threads**

- 🔍 Concepts:
  - Process vs Program
  - Process states: new, ready, running, waiting, terminated
  - Threads: Multithreading vs Multiprocessing
- ✍️ Do:
  - Write pseudocode that transitions a process through states.
  - Open Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac) and list 5 running processes.
  - Try `ps`, `top`, or `htop` on Linux.

---

### **Day 3: Scheduling Algorithms**

- 🔍 Concepts:
  - First-Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Context switching and time slices
- 🧪 Practice:
  - Use a spreadsheet or simple JS/Python to simulate each algorithm.
  - Draw a Gantt chart for a 3-process scenario.

---

### **Day 4: Memory Management**

- 🔍 Concepts:
  - RAM, virtual memory
  - Paging vs Segmentation
  - Memory hierarchy: Cache, RAM, HDD/SSD
- ✍️ Do:
  - Label a diagram of memory hierarchy.
  - Watch how Task Manager shows memory use (especially "virtual memory").

---

### **Day 5: File Systems & I/O**

- 🔍 Concepts:
  - File structure & directory trees
  - File allocation methods: contiguous, linked, indexed
  - I/O management, buffers, device drivers
- ✍️ Do:
  - Explore Linux commands: `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `cat`, `rm`
  - Sketch a directory tree and example file allocation

---

### **Weekend Practice & Reflection**

- ▶️ Review:
  - CrashCourse OS Episodes 3–6
- 🧠 Build:
  - A visual or paper model of:
    - Process Scheduling (with Gantt chart)
    - Memory Paging (page tables and frames)
- 📝 Quiz:
  - Create 10 flashcards (physical or digital) covering terms learned.
- 🗣 Reflection:
  - Write a paragraph summarizing the most surprising thing you learned.

## ✅ Weekly Target

By the end of the week, you should:

- Understand key OS concepts (process, thread, memory, file system).
- Be able to explain at least one scheduling algorithm.
- Use basic OS commands in Linux or macOS.
- Feel confident about starting CSIS 2260 in the Fall.
