# CSIS 2200 - Day 3

Topic: The Value of Information & Information Systems in Organizations

## Key Concepts

1. Value of Information (VOI)

   - Information only has value if it helps someone make a decision or take action.
   - The value increases when information:
     - Reduces uncertainty
     - Supports strategic decision-making
     - Improves efficiency or productivity

2. Information Quality Dimensions

   - Accuracy – Is the data correct?
   - Timeliness – Is it up-to-date?
   - Relevance – Does it help the user?
   - Completeness – Is anything missing?
   - Consistency – Does it match other data?

3. Alignment with Organizational Strategy

   - IT should not exist just for technology’s sake.
   - Information Systems (IS) must support:
     - Business goals
     - Competitive advantage
     - Core processes

4. Business Process Improvement (BPI)

    - Information systems can improve:
        - Cost reduction
        - Time savings
        - Workflow automation
        - Decision-making
        - Example tools: ERP, CRM, BI dashboards

5. Ethical Use of Information

   - Must ensure:
        - Privacy is protected (e.g., customer data)
        - Data is used for intended purpose only
        - Transparent communication about usage

## Reflection Questions

1. Can you think of a time when good information helped you make a better decision?

2. Have you ever worked at a company where the information system wasn’t aligned with the business needs? What happened?

3. How do you evaluate if a report or dashboard is trustworthy?

## Optional Practice

- Watch this YouTube video: “What Is the Value of Information?”
- Try writing 3 real-life situations where quality information changed an outcome (personal or professional).
- Review your favorite app or website: How does it display or use information? Is it valuable to you?
