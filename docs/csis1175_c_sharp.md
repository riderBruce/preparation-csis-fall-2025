This course introduces students to computing science and programming. It includes fundamental concepts and terminology of computing science, program design and fundamental building blocks for programming in a high-level language. Topics cover, but are not limited to Windows forms, properties, pseudo code, data types, arrays, operators, control structures, methods, classes, objects, and fundamental algorithms.

Students may conduct research as part of their coursework in this class. Instructors for the course are responsible for ensuring that student research projects comply with College policies on ethical conduct for research involving humans, which can require obtaining Informed Consent from participants and getting the approval of the Douglas College Research Ethics Board prior to conducting the research.

Learning outcomes

At the end of this course, successful students will be able to:

1. describe the process of program design and development;

2. develop a structured console program given a well-defined specification;

3. differentiate various data types and expressions;

4. describe the use of variables and constants and their scope in a program;

5. state the purpose of methods;

6. differentiate different forms of parameters of a method;

7. demonstrate basic object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, properties, methods, constructors, etc.;

8. implement different flows of controls such as conditional statements and repetitions;

9. implement basic data structures such as one-dimensional arrays, two dimensional arrays, dictionaries, and list ;

10. utilize different GUI forms and controls to build windows form applications;

11. implement the process of file I/O;

12. design a working program to solve a well-defined problem.
