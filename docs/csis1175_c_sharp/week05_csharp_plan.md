# 🗓️ Week 5 Plan – CSIS 1175: Introduction to Programming (C#) – Round 2

This week we return to C# with deeper, more structured challenges to reinforce core concepts and prepare for Fall 2025.

### 📍 Goal of the Week

Strengthen your understanding of C# programming with real-world simulations, object-oriented design, and small console app projects.

### 📅 Daily Breakdown

#### ✅ **Day 1 – Review & Warm-up**

- Review syntax: variables, conditions, loops
- Practice with mini console apps
- Refactor previous `MiniContactBook` logic into a console version

#### 🚧 **Day 2 – OOP Refresher**

- Classes, Objects, Fields, and Properties
- Constructors and Method overloading
- Build a "Student Manager" app (add/list/search students)

#### 🚧 **Day 3 – File I/O & Data Persistence**

- Read/Write from `.txt` and `.csv`
- Simulate saving student records
- Practice `StreamWriter`, `StreamReader`, and `File` class

#### 🚧 **Day 4 – Inheritance & Polymorphism**

- `base`, `override`, `virtual`
- Refactor Student Manager into `Person > Student`, `Teacher`, etc.
- Add functionality to filter/search by role

#### 🚧 **Day 5 – Error Handling & Validation**

- `try-catch-finally`, input validation
- Create robust user input logic for Student Manager
- Practice with intentional error scenarios

#### 🧠 **Optional Weekend**

- Build a mini-console quiz game
- Explore `enum`, `switch`, or LINQ basics
- Add a `JSON` export/import feature

### 🔧 Tools

- Visual Studio / VS Code
- .NET SDK (latest stable)

### 📘 Deliverables

- Journal entries for each day
- Final refactored Student Manager console app
- GitHub commits pushed daily
