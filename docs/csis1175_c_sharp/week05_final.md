# 📘 Week 5 – Final Review & Bonus Topics Wrap-up (CSIS 1175 Warm-up)

📅 Date: 2025-08-01
📍 Focus: Reinforcing Bonus Topics + Final Journal for the C# Warm-up Month

## ✅ Covered Topics this Week

### 🧼 Part 4 – Code Cleanup & Validator

- Built `StudentValidator.cs` to clean input
- Used recursive methods like `ReadValidName()` and `ReadValidAge()`
- Applied validation logic before adding a student
- Improved UX with clear prompts and valid checks

### 🧬 Day 5 – Inheritance & Polymorphism

- Created `Person`, `Student`, and `Teacher` classes
- Used `override` to customize `GetDetails()`
- Built polymorphic JSON converter
- Loaded/saved mixed types (Student & Teacher) while preserving type info

### 🚀 Advanced Concepts & Bonus Topics

#### 1. Exception Handling

- Try-catch-finally block basics
- Where/when to catch exceptions (file I/O, parsing)
- Custom exception: not required now, but mentioned

#### 2. 2D Arrays

- Declared `string[,]` and `int[,]`
- Compared with `List<List<T>>` and why flattening is common
- LINQ still preferred in real-world

#### 3. Sorting & Searching Algorithms

- Bubble Sort explained and coded
- Binary Search vs. LINQ `.Find()`, `.FirstOrDefault()`
- Mentioned time complexity & efficiency

#### 4. Delegates & Events

- Introduced as callback system in GUI apps
- Sample with `Action<string>` delegate
- Not required now, but useful in WinForms/WPF

#### 5. Debugging Tools

- Breakpoints 🔴
- Step Into (F11), Step Over (F10), Step Out
- Watch window, call stack
- Pro dev trick: no need to `Console.WriteLine()` for everything 😎
