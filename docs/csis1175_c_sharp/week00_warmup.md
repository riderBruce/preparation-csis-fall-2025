# 🏁 Week 00 – Summer Wrap-Up

This week, I wrapped up my summer warm-up projects in Python.

## ✅ What I Finished

- Completed 7+ CLI projects (CSV, JSON, I/O, validation)
- Practiced writing tests and organizing reusable functions
- Learned how to structure a Python package

## 🧠 Reflections

- I became more comfortable with file operations and functions.
- Writing unit tests was challenging but valuable.
- I feel more ready for real programming classes now.

## 🎯 What’s Next

- Set up this preparation repo for my CSIS classes
- Review C# basics before school starts
- Begin week-by-week tracking in this repo
