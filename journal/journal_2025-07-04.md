## âœ… Todayâ€™s Achievements

We continued work on the **MiniContactBook GUI** project and made great progress by completing:

1. **Validation with Error Highlighting**  
   - Empty field checks  
   - Real-time UI feedback using `ErrorProvider`

2. **Sorting & Grouping Contacts**  
   - Alphabetical sorting  
   - Basic grouping by name's first letter using ListViewGroups

3. **Export to CSV and JSON**  
   - Saved contact data to a `.csv` and `.json` file  
   - Loaded back into the app correctly

This marked the completion of all core and advanced features of the GUI contact book.  
Weâ€™ll polish the design (icons, layout, focus behavior) **tomorrow** as our final touch.
