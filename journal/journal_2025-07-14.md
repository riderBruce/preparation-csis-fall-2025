## 🧾 Program vs Process

- A **program** is a passive set of instructions.
- A **process** is an active instance of a program in execution.
  - An executable file = CPU instructions + data.
  - A process’s memory region includes:
    - **Text** (code)
    - **Data** (global/static variables)
    - **Heap** (dynamically allocated memory)
    - **Stack** (function calls, local variables)

## 📦 Pseudocode

### 🎯 Benefits of Using Pseudocode

- Simplifies the logic of a program.
- Easier to communicate with non-programmers.
- Saves time and helps prevent mistakes during coding.

### 😇 Pseudocode Writing Procedure

1. Understand the problem.
2. Break down the problem into smaller steps.
3. Write the pseudocode.
4. Test the pseudocode.
5. Translate it into actual code.

## 🥾 Pseudocode Practice

```python
start_program()
load_to_memory()
state = "Ready"
while not finished:
    if CPU_available():
        state = "Runnning"
        execute_task()
    else:
        state = "Waiting"
state = "Terminated"
```

## 🌌 State of a process (Process State)

```text
New -> Ready -> Running -> Waiting -> Ready -> Running - - - > Terminated
```

## 👨‍🏫 Terminal Practice

- ps aux : Check the process statues
  - STAT : indicate the statues of a process
    - RSDTZ : Run, Sleep, in Disk wait, sTopped, Zombie
- top / htop : Check the process, esp CPU% of each process

## 🫥 Processes vs Threads

### 🔜 Process

- Task under execution by CPU
- Process itself is an alone.
- Creation of process takes more time.
- Termination of process takes more time.
- Communication between processes takes more time.
- Doesn't share memory.
- Doesn't share data.
- Context-switching will take more time.
- Errors on processes doesn't effect on other.

### 🧵 Thread

- light-weight process
- Group of threads make process.
- Creation of thread is simple.
- Termination of thread is simple.
- Communication between threads is simple.
- Memory is shared.
- Data is shared.
- Context-switching is simple.
- Errors on threads affects on other.
