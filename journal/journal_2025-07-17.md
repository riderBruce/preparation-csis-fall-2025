# üß† CSIS 2260 Preview - Day 4: Memory Management

Daily Journal - 2025-07-14~18
It took so much time for practing below code.

## üì¶ Memory Concepts

### üìò Paging vs Segmentation

**Paging**:

- Memory is divided into small fixed-size units (e.g., 4KB).
- Logical memory is divided into pages, and physical memory into frames.
- A page table maps logical pages to physical frames.
- Simple allocation, but may lead to **internal fragmentation** (wasted space inside a page).
- Example: A process needs 6KB, but each page is 4KB ‚Üí It needs 2 pages (8KB total), wasting 2KB.

**Segmentation**:

- Memory is divided by variable-sized blocks based on the program's logical structure (code, stack, data, etc.).
- Each segment is contiguous in memory.
- May cause **external fragmentation** (free spaces scattered in memory).
- Example: A process wants 10KB, but only 3KB + 4KB + 3KB scattered ‚Üí Not allocatable.

### üíª Virtual Memory vs RAM

- **RAM** (Random Access Memory) is fast, expensive, and limited in size.
- **Virtual Memory** uses disk space (like SSD/HDD) to simulate additional memory by **swapping**.
- The OS loads needed memory parts into RAM and offloads unused ones to disk.
- Makes programs feel like they have more memory than the actual RAM installed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Memory Allocation Simulation (First-Fit Strategy)

[Python File link](../mini-projects/csis2260_operating_system/simulate_paging/memory_simulation.py)

```python
class MemoryManager:
    def __init__(self, total_frames):
        self.total_frames: int = total_frames
        self.frames: list = [None] * total_frames  # None means free
        self.history: list = []  # track order for optional swapping

    def allocate(self, process):
        while True:
            # not enough free indices
            free_indices_count = self.frames.count(None)
            if free_indices_count < process.size:
                print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Memory full. Swapping out P{self.history[0]}")
                self.swap_out(self.history[0])
                continue

            start_idx = self.find_first_fit(process.size)

            # not enough big block
            if start_idx is None:
                print(f"‚ùå Not enough contiguous space for P{process.pid}. Swapping out P{self.history[0]}")
                self.swap_out(self.history[0])
                continue

            # allocate
            for i in range(start_idx, start_idx + process.size):
                self.frames[i] = process.pid
            self.history.append(process.pid)
            print(f"‚úÖ Allocated P{process.pid} to frames {start_idx} to {start_idx + process.size - 1}")
            break

    def find_first_fit(self, size: int):
        for i in range(self.total_frames - size + 1):
            if self.is_contiguous_free_block(i, size):
                return i
        return None

    def is_contiguous_free_block(self, start_idx, size):
        for i in range(size):
            if self.frames[start_idx + i] is not None:
                return False
        return True

    def swap_out(self, pid):
        for i in range(self.total_frames):
            if self.frames[i] == pid:
                self.frames[i] = None
        self.history.remove(pid)
```

## üß† Reflections

- The simulation code helped me truly understand internal vs external fragmentation.
- Recursion in allocation was surprisingly elegant‚Äîit retries naturally after swap.
- find_first_fit sometimes returns None (no contiguous block), and that‚Äôs OK‚Äîit matches the real-world issue of fragmentation.
- Method naming like find_first_fit() or is_ready() replaces comments and improves clarity. I love that.
