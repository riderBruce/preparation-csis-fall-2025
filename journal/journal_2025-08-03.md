# 📘 Journal – Week 6, Day 4: CSS Grid Fundamentals

## 🧠 What I Learned Today

Today, I studied the **CSS Grid** layout system and its power in creating 2D layouts. Unlike Flexbox, which focuses on one dimension at a time (either row or column), Grid allows simultaneous control of rows and columns. That makes it ideal for complex page structures like dashboards, galleries, and responsive templates.

I explored:

- `display: grid` to initiate grid layout
- `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` to define structure
- `grid-area` and `grid-template-areas` for semantic and readable layout mapping
- `gap`, `row-gap`, and `column-gap` to control spacing
- Responsive techniques using `repeat(auto-fit, minmax())`

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Using **named areas** like `"header header" "sidebar main" "footer footer"` makes layout management easier to understand and maintain.
- Grid layout can be applied **within any container**, not just the whole page.
- A properly structured Grid system improves **maintainability**, **responsiveness**, and **readability**.
- `grid-template-areas` didn’t work as expected at first because all defined columns must match the structure’s declared column count.

## 🛠️ What I Built

- A **dashboard layout** with header, sidebar, main content, and footer using `grid-template-areas`
- A **responsive photo grid** with `repeat(auto-fit, minmax())`
- Tested Grid inside nested `<div>`s

## 🤔 Reflections

Flexbox was already great, but Grid made me feel even more confident in managing layouts on any device size. Combining Grid and media queries gives full control to adapt designs. Today’s demos and templates were extremely helpful, and I plan to reuse the patterns in my future projects.
