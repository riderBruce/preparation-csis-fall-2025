## âœ… Kickoff for Week 04 â€“ CSIS 2200: Systems Analysis & Design

Today we reviewed the official course description and outcomes for CSIS 2200. We confirmed that our previous week's project-based work (Week 03) has already given us useful experience in:

- Thinking about system components
- Structuring and storing information
- Working with user interaction logic
- Recording and visualizing data

We also confirmed that it's time to shift our focus to a more **business-oriented and theory-grounded** approach.

## ðŸ§­ Whatâ€™s Next

Tomorrow, we begin with the concept of _systems_ â€“ their components and how they work together. Weâ€™ll also compare a system with a regular application and understand the idea of **system boundaries** and **inputs/outputs**.

This new direction feels exciting and ties everything together.
