### 🧪 Simulation Practice: First-Fit Allocation with Swap
[💾 Practice File](../mini-projects/csis2260_operating_system/simulate_paging/memory_simulation_practice.py)

#### ✅ Features Implemented:
- Allocates process if enough **contiguous memory** exists.
- Swaps out the oldest process (FIFO) when memory is full or fragmented.
- Tracks memory state using a frame array.
- Clear printout after every allocation.

#### 🛠️ Code Elements:
- `Process` class: Holds PID and size.
- `MemoryManagement` class:
  - `allocate(process)`: main logic
  - `select_first_section(size)`: finds first fit
  - `swap_out(pid)`: frees memory
  - `print_current_statues()`: shows current memory map

#### 🧠 Reflection:
- Practicing "blind" code without referencing the previous version helped build real understanding.
- Recursive `while True` retry logic was clear and functional.
- Keeping `is_contiguous_memory()` as a helper made the code more readable.
- The logic was same even with renamed variables.

### 💡 What I Learned
- Same process can be written in different style with same logic.
- Helper functions with good names remove the need for extra comments.
- Returning `None` to signal failure is okay, as long as handled clearly.
- Naming and clean separation make code easier to explain and debug.
