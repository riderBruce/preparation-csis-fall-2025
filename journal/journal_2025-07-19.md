## ✅ Topics Covered

- Final part of the memory management module: **Paging simulation**
- Added CSV export to log memory mappings
- Used `@dataclass` for clear `PageEntry` structure
- Practiced handling **page hits** and **page faults**
- Logged mapping of logical pages to physical frames

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Virtual Memory**: Address translation using page tables
- **Page Fault Handling**: When a page isn't in memory, allocate a free frame
- **Memory Logging**: Used the `csv` module to output a memory map log file
- **Filename Handling**: Used timestamps (`datetime.now().strftime`) to create unique, safe filenames
- **@dataclass**: Simplified page structure with automatic `__init__`, `__repr__`, etc.

## 💻 Code Highlights

```python
@dataclass
class PageEntry:
    page_number: int
    frame_number: int

...

def export_memory_map(self):
    filename = self.log_file
    with open(filename, mode='w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(["logical_page", "physical_frame"])
        for entry in self.mapping.values():
            writer.writerow([entry.page_number, entry.frame_number])
```

## 🔍 Reflection

> Today’s practice helped me understand how a **paging system** handles logical to physical address translation and how to **track memory behavior** through logs. Exporting to CSV made the simulation more real-world and tangible. I now feel more confident with both memory concepts and file I/O in Python.
