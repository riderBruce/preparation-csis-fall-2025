# 📓 Week 6 Journal – CSIS 1280 (Web Development)

**Dates:** August 4 – August 10, 2025  
**Focus:** JavaScript ES6+ and modern array methods

---

## 📅 Weekly Progress

### **Day 1–4 Recap**

- Reviewed HTML semantics, CSS layouts (Flexbox & Grid), and responsive design.
- Built a responsive contact form with dark mode toggle.
- Implemented a highlighter app using `localStorage` for persistence.

### **Day 5–7**

- Learned modern ES6+ syntax:
  - `var`, `let`, `const` and block scope.
  - Arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, default parameters, tagged templates.
- Practiced `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `find()`, `some()`, `every()` for array transformation and querying.
- Completed **6 coding tasks** applying these methods to practical scenarios.

---

## 🏆 Key Achievements

- Wrote clean, functional JavaScript using ES6+ features.
- Improved understanding of array methods by solving real-world data problems.
- Built habits for naming clarity and code readability.
- Learned subtle ES6 distinctions like **spread vs rest operator**.

---

## 📌 Challenges & Lessons Learned

- Need to be mindful of naming conventions (`finded` → `found`).
- Case sensitivity in string filtering requires deliberate handling (`startsWith()` vs `toLowerCase()`).
- Using object methods like `Object.values()` is efficient for property checks.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Move on to **Week 7 – CSIS 2260 (Operating Systems)**.
- For JavaScript, practice **spread/rest operators**, **modules**, and **fetch API** in future rotations.
- Apply ES6+ methods in mini-projects for stronger retention.

**Reflection:**  
This week solidified the foundation for JavaScript ES6+ features and functional programming with arrays. By combining theory with small, hands-on challenges, progress felt tangible and motivating.  
The exercises were short but realistic enough to mimic real coding tasks, which made the learning experience engaging.
