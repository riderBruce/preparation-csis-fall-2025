### üí° Real-World Reflection Prompts

1. **Have you ever interacted with a POS system or self-checkout machine?**  
   No, but I have experience using an ERP system developed by SAP.  
   I worked as an accountant at a construction company. My previous company adopted SAP to manage everything from sales and accounts payable/receivable to payroll, financial reporting, progress tracking, and collecting information from site offices.

2. **Think about your previous job ‚Äî did your department use any software tools to manage records?**  
   Yes, I worked mainly with the ERP system, as well as an HRD system for hiring and payroll, and a PMS (Project Management System) for managing construction progress.  
   Most of these systems were integrated with SAP.

3. **What do you think are the benefits and risks of using one large enterprise system vs multiple small functional systems?**  
   I believe both approaches have their pros and cons.  
   A large enterprise system is efficient and allows departments to access integrated information quickly. However, it can be difficult to modify or expand because of its size and complexity.  
   On the other hand, smaller functional systems are easier to customize and update for specific needs. But they often use different formats, codes, and data structures, making integration across departments difficult and time-consuming.  
   Overall, companies tend to shift their information systems as they grow, balancing between flexibility and integration.

### üéØ Quick Quiz (Review Answers)

1. **What is the main goal of a transactional system?**  
   To record and process day-to-day business transactions, such as sales, payments, and inventory updates.

2. **Why might a company choose to implement an ERP system?**  
   As a company grows, separate systems like POS or payroll software may no longer provide a complete picture or timely access to data.  
   An ERP system can integrate information from all departments and streamline communication across the organization.

3. **What could go wrong if departmental systems aren't integrated?**  
   Each department may use different codes, formats, and categories, which makes data consolidation very difficult.  
   Decision-makers may face delays and inaccuracies when trying to analyze information from multiple sources.  
   Over time, this inefficiency can hurt business performance, which is why large companies often adopt ERP systems.

## üìò Journal ‚Äì Reflections on Data Quality

### üîé Real-World Reflection

1. **Have you ever made a bad decision because of missing or wrong information?**  
   Yes. When I was working as a site financial manager in Yeosu, the ERP system showed that the site‚Äôs indirect budget was sufficient. Based on that information, we planned generous welfare activities for staff and workers.  
   However, it turned out that the budget input in the ERP system was incorrect. After spending a significant amount of the indirect budget, we realized the error and had to cancel plans like picnics and accommodations. It was a hard lesson about the importance of data accuracy.

2. **What are some examples in business where poor data quality caused problems?**  
   When integrating information across different systems, data such as department codes, employee IDs, or budget items must match.  
   If data is missing, duplicated, or mismatched, the integration can fail completely. I've seen projects delayed or abandoned because of poor-quality master data that made accurate reporting or decision-making impossible.

3. **Think about one system (an app, a report, or a dashboard) you use ‚Äî how would you improve the _quality of its information_?**  
   I use map applications frequently ‚Äî for finding restaurants, navigating routes, or getting a feel for a neighborhood. While the core map data is very helpful, the quality of user reviews is sometimes lacking.  
   Too few reviews or fake ones can lead to poor decisions.  
   I think a small incentive system ‚Äî like a credibility or badge system for reviewers ‚Äî could help improve both the quantity and quality of useful feedback.

### üå± Final Thought

This reflection reminded me that good systems are not only about design and integration but also about the accuracy and trustworthiness of the data they carry.
