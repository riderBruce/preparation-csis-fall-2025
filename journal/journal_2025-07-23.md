### üí° Real-World Reflection Prompts

1. **Have you ever interacted with a POS system or self-checkout machine?**  
   No, but I have experience using an ERP system developed by SAP.  
   I worked as an accountant at a construction company. My previous company adopted SAP to manage everything from sales and accounts payable/receivable to payroll, financial reporting, progress tracking, and collecting information from site offices.

2. **Think about your previous job ‚Äî did your department use any software tools to manage records?**  
   Yes, I worked mainly with the ERP system, as well as an HRD system for hiring and payroll, and a PMS (Project Management System) for managing construction progress.  
   Most of these systems were integrated with SAP.

3. **What do you think are the benefits and risks of using one large enterprise system vs multiple small functional systems?**  
   I believe both approaches have their pros and cons.  
   A large enterprise system is efficient and allows departments to access integrated information quickly. However, it can be difficult to modify or expand because of its size and complexity.  
   On the other hand, smaller functional systems are easier to customize and update for specific needs. But they often use different formats, codes, and data structures, making integration across departments difficult and time-consuming.  
   Overall, companies tend to shift their information systems as they grow, balancing between flexibility and integration.

### üéØ Quick Quiz (Review Answers)

1. **What is the main goal of a transactional system?**  
   To record and process day-to-day business transactions, such as sales, payments, and inventory updates.

2. **Why might a company choose to implement an ERP system?**  
   As a company grows, separate systems like POS or payroll software may no longer provide a complete picture or timely access to data.  
   An ERP system can integrate information from all departments and streamline communication across the organization.

3. **What could go wrong if departmental systems aren't integrated?**  
   Each department may use different codes, formats, and categories, which makes data consolidation very difficult.  
   Decision-makers may face delays and inaccuracies when trying to analyze information from multiple sources.  
   Over time, this inefficiency can hurt business performance, which is why large companies often adopt ERP systems.
