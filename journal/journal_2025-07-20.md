# ✅ OS Study Summary (Week 3)

## 1. 📄 Scheduling Algorithms

    - FCFS, SJF (non-preemptive), RR studied and simulated
    - Built class-based reusable architecture
    - Practiced helpers, inheritance, super(), and @dataclass
    - Journaled reflections and code

## 2. 🧠 Memory Management

    - Concepts: paging vs. segmentation, RAM vs. virtual memory
    - Simulated memory allocation (first fit with fragmentation + swap)
    - Address translation with page table
    - Used @dataclass for PageEntry
    - Handled page faults and frame management
    - Generated a memory mapping CSV log using File I/O

## 3. 📂 File I/O

    - Used Python’s csv module to export memory logs
    - Introduced basic concepts of reading/writing with files

## 4. ✍️ Journaling

    - Maintained structured .md journal entries for each study day
    - Reflected on key learnings, new concepts, and code improvements

## 🧾 Final Status

There’s nothing left from our Week 1 plan. You even:

- Practiced blind re-implementation of simulators
- Deepened your understanding with helper functions, decorators, and best practices
