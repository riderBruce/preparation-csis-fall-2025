## 🧑‍💻 What I Worked On

Today, I focused on polishing the **Mini Contact Book** GUI and wrapping up the core features for the CSIS1175 practice project. This included both technical improvements and user experience enhancements.

## 🎨 GUI Enhancements

- Enabled `FullRowSelect` and `GridLines` for better ListView visibility
- Applied a modern font (`Segoe UI`, size 10) to make it easier to read
- Added tooltips for all buttons to improve user guidance
- Implemented placeholder behavior in all input textboxes (`txtName`, `txtPhone`, `txtEmail`)
  - Placeholder text appears in gray
  - Clears when focused, restored when empty and unfocused

## ✅ Features Completed

- Error highlighting for required fields (Name & Phone)
- Column sorting (ascending/descending) on click
- Grouping contacts by first letter of the name
- Exporting contacts to CSV and JSON formats
- Code clean-up and visual consistency improvements

## 💡 Reflections

This project was a solid foundation for understanding how Windows Forms apps work. I practiced a lot with event handling, form design, validation logic, and file I/O.

Instead of versioning this app, I decided to leave it as a reference milestone. In the future, I plan to build a more advanced version with database support, search filters, and better design.

## 🗓 Next Steps

Tomorrow, I will begin preparing for the **next course** in rotation.  
The Mini Contact Book served as my prep project for **CSIS1175 (Intro to Programming)**.  
Three more courses to go!

Let’s move forward!
