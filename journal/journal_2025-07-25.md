## ðŸŽ¯ Reflection Journal â€“ System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. Have you ever been part of a project (school or work) that followed a step-by-step process like SDLC? What did that look like?

Yes, I was part of a project called the **BSC system** while working in the planning office. Since I was a junior and unfamiliar with the full process, I remember that the consulting firm mentioned the **Waterfall model**. We built a plan and followed a step-by-step timeline. After completing all the interviews, we moved to the next step. However, the project was delayed due to a simple comment from the management, which highlights how fragile strict step-based planning can be.

### 2. Which phase do you think is most critical? Why?

I believe the **Design phase** is the most critical. During this phase, the actual data is checked to create the architectural design. Many employees â€” especially those in management â€” assume clean, reliable data exists, when in fact the data is often modified or inconsistent.

Iâ€™ve experienced several cases where a big project plan was made, but implementation failed because the necessary detail-level data wasn't properly reviewed. Only **clean data** can be handled effectively by software. Ensuring that data is accurate and formatted correctly happens during the Design phase, which makes it a crucial checkpoint.

### 3. What might happen if a team skips the Testing or Planning phase?

When building a project, many decisions must be made, and a **solid plan provides direction** for those choices. Without planning, the team can easily lose its way.

If the **Testing phase** is skipped, the system will likely face problems that werenâ€™t anticipated. Testing helps identify potential errors and simulate various scenarios. It ensures that the final system is **reliable** and minimizes errors for end users. Skipping this step can lead to costly failures or loss of user trust.
