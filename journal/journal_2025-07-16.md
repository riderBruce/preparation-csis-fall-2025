## 🚧 Continuing OOP and Scheduling Simulation

Today I built on yesterday’s momentum by refactoring my scheduling simulators using **base classes and inheritance**. This made all three algorithms — FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin — share common code cleanly. I now understand why we use `super().__init__()` and when it’s needed, especially when a subclass adds extra behavior.

### ✅ Class Improvements
- Created `BaseScheduler` to avoid duplicated code.
- Moved common logic (`calculate_metrics`, `print_results`) into the base class.
- Each algorithm now only implements its own scheduling logic in `run()`.



## 🧱 Design Thinking

I learned to write small **helper methods** inside my class — like `is_ready(p)` or `pick_shortest_burst_time()` — instead of filling `run()` with conditions. These helpers make the logic **self-explanatory without comments**, thanks to good naming.

> ✨ "Readable code is self-documenting."

I also learned:
- Put helper functions **above the main logic** (top-down readability).
- Keep the `main()` function clean and use `if __name__ == '__main__':` properly.



## 🎀 Decorator Exploration

I began learning about **decorators** like:
- `@staticmethod`
- `@classmethod`
- `@property`
- `@lru_cache`
- `@dataclass`

These are powerful Python tools that modify function behavior. I now understand that:
- `@staticmethod` is great for logic not tied to any instance (`self`).
- `@property` allows me to use methods like attributes.
- `@dataclass` reduces boilerplate in data-focused classes.



## 🔁 Thought of the Day

> “Code is not just for machines — it’s for humans to read first.”

I’m starting to love the *design* side of programming. OOP, clean structure, helpers, and decorators all help make code elegant, reusable, and easier to understand.
