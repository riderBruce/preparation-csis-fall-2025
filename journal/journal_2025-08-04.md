# 📝 Journal – Forms & Validation

## ✨ What I Learned

- How to build a clean and structured HTML form
- How to validate form fields in real-time using input event
- How to prevent form submission using e.preventDefault()
- How to show custom error messages dynamically
- The basics of RegEx for validating patterns like email and password

## 💡 What Changed

- Last time, I handled all of this using jQuery, which abstracts a lot of details.
- This time, I saw exactly how validation works step by step, and I debugged using console.log() in Chrome DevTools.
- I realized how important clean logic and correct parentheses () are in JavaScript — one typo can break everything!

## 🔍 Reflection

- Writing validations in plain JavaScript is a bit more manual, but gives me full control.
- Real-time validation is cool, but I learned that it needs proper condition checks to prevent auto-submitting when the form is valid.
