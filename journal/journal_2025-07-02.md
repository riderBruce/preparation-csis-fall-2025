## 👨‍💻 What I Did Today

Today I upgraded my Mini Contact Book app using C# Windows Forms and replaced the basic ListBox with a multi-column ListView. It now supports:

- Adding, editing, and deleting contacts with name, phone, and email

- Saving all contacts to a text file (contacts.txt)

- Loading contacts from file and displaying them in the ListView

- Searching for a contact by name and scrolling to it

- Updating selected contacts with new values

- Input field placeholder behavior and clearing fields after actions

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to use ListViewItem and its SubItems to manage multi-column contact data

- How to save structured data to a text file and parse it line by line

- How to split and assign parts of a string to different fields

- The importance of clearing selections (SelectedItems.Clear()) and managing UI state

- Error handling with File.Exists and user confirmations (like delete dialogs)

## 🧠 Concepts I Need to Review

- How to check for duplicates using ListViewItem properly

- Try out ListViewItemComparer if I want sorting

- Possibly use CSV or JSON format for better future compatibility

## 💬 Notes

Today’s GUI work was really fun and I feel more comfortable with C# Windows Forms now. It’s different from Python, but it’s manageable and very useful. Next, I’d like to add some form validations or maybe export to CSV.
