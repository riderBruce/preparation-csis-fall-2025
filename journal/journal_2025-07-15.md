  1. Avoid Deep Nesting
     - Inversion
     - Extraction
  2. Avoid Code Duplication
  3. Don't use the name you only understand

  1. Extraction
     - pull out part of the function
  2. Inversion
     - flipping condition and swiching to an early return
     - put the unhappy first
     - validation and gatekeeping section

  1. Use for execution
     ```python
     if __name__ == '__main__':
     ```
  2. Keep all inside in main() (like psvm : public static void main(string[] args))
     ```python
     def main():
         do_this()
         and_do_this()

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         main()
     ```
  3. Extraction from big functions to small pieces
  4. Type Annotations
  5. List Comprehensions

### 🎯 Concepts & Tips

- **Snippet**: A small piece or brief extract of code.
- **Ternary operators** are for returning values, *not* side effects like assignment or printing:
  ```python
  # ✅ Good
  status = "ready" if is_active else "pending"

  # ❌ Not recommended
  is_ready and print("Ready")  # Side effect use
  ```
  
### Scheduler Coding with Class
- [Round Robin Scheduler](../mini-projects/csis2260_operating_system/simulate_Round_Robin/simulate_rr_class_practice.py)
- I finally understand OOP better than I did yesterday.
- The class-based code is elegant and feels structured.
- Inside a class, I can group both states (data) and behaviors (functions) together.
- It's clearer and more maintainable than procedural code.

- 📦 An object has:
	1.	State → data inside it (like a process’s arrival time)
	2.	Behavior → what it can do (like calculate waiting time)
