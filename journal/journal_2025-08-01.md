# 📘 CSIS 1280 – Week 6 Day 1: HTML Structure & Semantics Review

## ✅ What I Reviewed

Today, I reviewed the use of **semantic HTML tags** and **CSS layout concepts** like `flex` and `media queries`.  
I learned how elements like `<article>` and `<aside>` provide structure and context to content, improving accessibility and clarity.  
In CSS, I revisited how the `flex` layout helps divide space proportionally and respond to screen size changes using `flex-direction` and `@media` rules.

Together, these tools help construct a responsive and well-organized web page frame.

## 🧠 Semantic Tags & Layout Insights

I rediscovered how powerful proper semantic tags can be. Tags like:

- `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`

...offer a clear blueprint for structuring web content.

Even beyond front-end design, I realized this approach can help when organizing content in any software system—by making roles of each section explicit and understandable.

## 🛠️ Mini Project Reflection

In a past project, I created a web page to display a large dataset.  
At the time, I used many `<div>` boxes for layout—some stacked vertically, some horizontally. Visually it worked okay, but lacked clarity and scalability.

If I had known about semantic tags and responsive media queries then, the layout would have been far easier to manage and improve.  
Today’s lesson gave me practical tools to refactor such work in the future more cleanly.
