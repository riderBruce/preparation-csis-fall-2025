## 🗓️ Week Overview

This week was dedicated to practicing Web Development fundamentals. I focused on mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through interactive, hands-on mini projects. I learned not only the syntax but also how to structure my code, organize files, and make my UI responsive and interactive.

## 💭 Reflection

I feel proud of what I’ve achieved this week. I didn’t just read or watch tutorials — I built things with my own hands. That helped me retain what I learned and made web development fun and rewarding.

I understand I need more practice, but these mini projects gave me confidence and a strong foundation to build from.
