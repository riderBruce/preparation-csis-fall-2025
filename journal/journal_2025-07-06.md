# 🌐 CSIS 1280 – Web Development Prep Journal

## 📅 Day 1: Getting Started with HTML

Today I wrote my HTML file!  
I learned how to create a basic web page using:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<html>` structure
- `<head>` and `<body>` tags
- Headings (`<h1>`) and paragraphs (`<p>`)

🔧 I used Live Server to run my web page locally and see changes in real time.  
My simple page said:

> **Hello, Web Development!**  
> I'm Youngil Kim, and I'm learning CSIS to gain more academic knowledge.  
> This is my step toward learning CSIS 1280.

It was a small start, but exciting.

## 📅 Day 2: HTML Core Tags and Building My Profile Page

Today I practiced the most important HTML tags:

- `<img>` to show a photo
- `<strong>`, `<em>` for bold and italic
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` for lists
- `<a>` for clickable links
- `<hr>`, `<br>` for spacing
- `<title>` for the browser tab name

🔨 I made a personal profile page:

- My name and photo
- A short paragraph introducing myself
- A list of my interests (like coding, swimming, biking)
- Links to GitHub and email

👁️ The result looks clean, readable, and very “me.”  
I even added emojis in the titles to make the layout more fun and welcoming.

🧭 Tomorrow (Day 3), I’ll start learning about CSS and how to style my profile page with colors, spacing, and layout.

Let’s keep going!
