# 📘 Day 3 Journal – File I/O and Refactoring with Enum (C#)

## 🗓️ Date: Week 5, Day 3

## 🧠 What I Learned Today

### ✅ 1. Refactoring Using `enum`

I learned how to define and use `enum` in C# for handling file types.

```csharp
public enum FileType { Txt, Csv, Json }
```

This made the code **cleaner**, **easier to read**, and **less repetitive**. I passed `FileType` as a parameter and used `switch` to route behavior.

---

### ✅ 2. Expression-Bodied Members (`=>`)

- The first arrow (`=>`) is a shorthand for returning a single expression from a method.

```csharp
private string GetDefaultPath(FileType fileType) => fileType switch { ... };
```

- It's a clean and elegant way to write one-liner methods, especially when paired with `switch` expressions.

---

### ✅ 3. Clean Architecture

- I extracted logic into **helper methods**:
  - `ValidateSaveConditions()`
  - `GetDefaultPath()`
- Then moved the **core logic** like `SaveToFile()` and `LoadFromFile()` into private methods.
- The result was a main method that read like a **pseudocode** or **navigation flow** — so easy to follow!

It felt like refactoring turned the code into a **traffic system** with enums like signs and helper methods like traffic lights. 🤓

---

### ✅ 4. When to Omit `{}` in C\#

- `{}` can be omitted in `if` or `foreach` **only if** there is **exactly one line** inside.

```csharp
if (x > 0)
    Console.WriteLine("Positive");
```

- But for readability and maintainability, I learned it's often better **not** to omit them, especially in professional code.

---

### ✅ 5. Python Has `enum` Too!

```python
from enum import Enum
class FileType(Enum):
    TXT = 'txt'
    CSV = 'csv'
    JSON = 'json'
```

Even though it’s different syntax, the idea of controlling logic with enum is universal and very powerful.

---

### ✅ 6. Habit of Refactoring

Even if a method is used only once now, building the habit of clean separation like `ValidateSaveConditions()` or `ValidateSaveAndLoadConditions()` improves long-term flexibility and readability. It's a good mindset for scalable code.

---

## 💬 Final Thoughts

Today’s refactor taught me more than just syntax. It showed me how a well-structured method, clean parameter handling, and proper use of enum can completely transform messy code into something scalable, readable, and beautiful.

From traffic police metaphors to enum-powered switches, I felt like a true software architect today. 🏗️

## 💪 Tomorrow’s Goal

Practice working with LINQ and deeper file operations like async reading/writing or XML format. Possibly add unit tests for each file type handler.
