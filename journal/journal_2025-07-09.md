# ðŸ“˜ Web Development Journal â€“ Day 7

Course: CSIS1280 â€“ Multimedia Web Development
Topic: Mini Project Practice + API Integration

## âœ… What I Did Today

- Practiced more JavaScript mini-projects to strengthen my frontend development skills.
- Finished:
  - Advice Generator App using the Advice Slip API.
  - Implemented loading state, error handling, and responsive design.
- Learned how to:
  - Use fetch() with async/await
  - Dynamically update the DOM based on API response
  - Handle API errors gracefully
  - Style components responsively
- Discussed the Pomodoro Timer as our next project but decided to rain check it for tomorrow due to time.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Reviewed

- API calls with fetch() and await
- Updating text content dynamically
- JavaScript event listeners
- Error handling with try/catch
- Making mobile-friendly layouts with @media queries

## ðŸ’¬ Reflections

Iâ€™m starting to feel comfortable with real-world JavaScript usage, especially how data flows from API â†’ logic â†’ DOM. These mini projects are powerful learning tools â€” they teach coding, design, and user interaction at the same time. Even though we postponed the Pomodoro Timer today, Iâ€™m excited to tackle it tomorrow!
