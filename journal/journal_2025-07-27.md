## ðŸ§  Reflection Prompts (Refined & Natural)

ðŸ”¹ What advantages did constructor overloading give you here?

    Constructor overloading allows multiple ways to create an object using different sets of parameters. This makes my code more flexible and user-friendly. For example, I can create a Student instance using just a name when full details aren't necessary. This saved me time when quickly inputting multiple students without needing to provide all the information every time.

ðŸ”¹ How did separating logic into StudentManager help your code structure?

    Separating the logic into StudentManager made my code much cleaner and more maintainable. It helped reduce redundancy by grouping related methods together. Having all the student-related operations in one place also makes the code easier to refactor, test, and reuse in future projects.

ðŸ”¹ Could this be extended into a GUI or database app?

    Absolutely. Since the logic is already separated into different layersâ€”Student.cs for the data model, StudentManager for the business logic, and Program.cs for the interfaceâ€”this structure can be easily expanded. For example, Student.cs could be mapped to a database table, StudentManager could handle data access or business rules, and Program.cs could be replaced by a GUI or web interface. I finally understand how separating logic helps make a program more scalable and adaptable.
