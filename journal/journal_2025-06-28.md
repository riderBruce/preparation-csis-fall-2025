# 🗓️ Journal – 2025-06-28

## ✅ What I Did Today

* Set up a new GitHub repo: `preparation-csis-fall-2025`
* Installed and configured VS Code on my Windows laptop
* Cloned the repo locally and created the basic folder structure
* Added `README.md`, `week00_warmup.md`, and class overview for CSIS 1175
* Made my first commit and successfully pushed to GitHub

## 💭 Reflections

Today was a big transition day — moving from MacBook and PyCharm to Windows and VS Code. It felt overwhelming at first, but now I feel more confident. The folder structure gives me a clear direction. I'm starting to enjoy organizing things for the long term.

It was also interesting to see how VS Code works differently. I like the flexibility, but I still miss some features from PyCharm.

## 🧠 What I Learned

* How to install Git and configure it on Windows
* How to use the VS Code Git panel for staging, committing, and pushing
* Folder structures matter — planning helps reduce future stress

## 📌 Goals for Tomorrow

* Start the `journal/` habit — daily updates like this
* Add a study checklist and daily tracker to the `docs/` folder
* Begin preparing notes for CSIS 1175 (C# basics)
* Possibly explore Visual Studio setup for Windows Forms (GUI)

Let’s keep up the momentum!
