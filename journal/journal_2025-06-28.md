**🌟 What I did today:**

* Successfully set up **Visual Studio** on my Windows laptop for C# development.
* Created my **first C# console app** — a simple "Hello, World" program.
* Built and ran a **Guessing Game** program:

  * Practiced using `Random` to generate a number.
  * Used `int.TryParse()` to safely convert user input.
  * Applied loops and conditionals in C#.
* Understood the basic C# syntax, which feels similar to Java (though I don’t know Java deeply).

**🧠 What I learned:**

* How C# structure is different from Python: strict types, `Main()` method, semicolons.
* The importance of `TryParse()` to handle invalid user input safely.
* How to write clean loops and feedback messages for user interaction.

**🛠️ Challenges:**

* Understanding the `Random` object and using `.Next()`.
* Grasping how `TryParse` works (still need to review and practice this more).

**💬 Reflection:**
Even though the language is new, I enjoyed building small C# programs. It feels rewarding to see results so quickly. It was a bit tiring to set up new tools, but now I feel more ready for CSIS 1175.

**✅ Next Steps:**

* Review the `Guessing Game` logic again tomorrow.
* Start exploring `Windows Forms` for GUI apps.
* Continue building confidence with C# syntax and structure.
