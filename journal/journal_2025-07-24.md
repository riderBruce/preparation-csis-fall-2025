## ðŸ“Œ Topic: System Components & Data Modeling (ER Diagrams)

### ðŸ’¬ Reflection Questions

1. **Can you think of a real-world example where systems components (like people and software) worked together effectively?**

   > In convenience stores, customers can pay after scanning a barcode, then the payment system reads their credit card for payment.  
   > Customer, scanner, and the system work together as one process.

2. **Have you ever seen an ER diagram before? Where or how?**

   > When I was building a database, it was hard to decide which property should be a primary key.  
   > Thatâ€™s when I learned about ERDs and saw how they help visualize relationships and keys.

3. **Why is it important to model data before building a system?**

   > Itâ€™s like a blueprint for a database that stores and retrieves data.  
   > If the modeling is not fixed or gets modified later, the entire systemâ€™s structure may also need changes, causing rework.
