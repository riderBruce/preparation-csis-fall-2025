# 📝 Journal: JavaScript Highlighting App Project

**Date:** 2025-08-07

## 🚀 Project Overview

Built a fully working **Text Highlighter Web App** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project allowed dynamic selection of text with custom and preset highlight colors, undo/clear functions, and a real-time preview of highlights saved in localStorage.

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

- 🔸 **Highlight Selection** using `<mark>` with customizable colors
- 🎨 **Color Pickers** (red, green, blue, custom hex)
- 🧠 **Undo** last highlight (stack behavior)
- 🧹 **Clear All** resets entire content while preserving original text
- 💾 **Save to localStorage**: highlighted text & class saved for review
- 🔍 **View Highlighted List** in a separate `<ul>` dynamically updated

---

## 🧠 Key JavaScript Concepts Practiced

- DOM Manipulation (`createElement`, `classList`, `innerHTML`, `insertNode`)
- Event Handling (`click`, `change`, `selection`)
- `getSelection()` and `getRangeAt(0)` for precise text handling
- `Array.push()` and `pop()` for undo logic (LIFO stack)
- `localStorage.setItem()` and `getItem()` for persistent state
- Conditional styling using `classList` vs `style.backgroundColor`

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Handling highlights line-by-line helped understand **selection API**
- Remembered **`.filter(msg => msg)`** to clean empty strings
- Used `startsWith("#")` to differentiate custom colors from classes
- Carefully designed functions to separate UI control and logic
- Writing logic to manipulate the DOM gave deeper insight into how JavaScript powers dynamic UI/UX

## 🌟 Reflection

> "This experience was so special. I could handle and discover another level of what’s possible in web interaction."

---

## 🧪 Potential Improvements

- Save exact text positions (range serialization)
- Animate scrolling to new highlights
- Convert to reusable components or React for better scalability
- Implement highlight removal via click

---

## 📂 Files Involved

- `index.html`
- `script.js`
- (Optional) `style.css` (embedded or separated)

---

## 🔚 Conclusion

This project taught me **practical frontend engineering**, not just theory.  
Thank you, myself, for being curious and patient. Let’s keep building!
