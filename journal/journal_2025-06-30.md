## 🧑‍💻 What I Did Today

Today, I continued developing my first C# GUI app: the **Mini Contact Book** using Windows Forms in Visual Studio. I made good progress and gained more comfort with form-based UI programming.

- Practiced setting `TabIndex` for input fields to control tabbing order
- Learned how to clear placeholder text when a text box is focused
- Saved and loaded contact information from a local file
- Improved my understanding of Visual Studio project structure and `.sln`, `.csproj`, and `Form1.cs` files
- Talked about the best way to manage GitHub commits during active development (will polish `README.md` later)

## 🤔 Reflections

I felt more confident using Visual Studio today. Although it’s quite different from Python, it feels a bit like Java in terms of syntax and structure. GUI development is exciting — I want to do more of this.

## 🔜 What's Next

- Implement contact editing and deleting
- Add a search box to filter contacts
- Polish the UI layout
- Create a final screenshot for GitHub
