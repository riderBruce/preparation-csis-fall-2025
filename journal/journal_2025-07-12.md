# Week 2 Journal: JavaScript Practice Projects

This week, I focused on strengthening my JavaScript skills by building multiple interactive mini-projects. These exercises helped me understand the structure and flow of JavaScript programs, especially DOM manipulation, event handling, localStorage, and API interaction.

## âœ… Projects Completed

### 1. Color Changer

- Built a button that changes the background color randomly using hex color codes.
- Learned about string manipulation, loops, and Math.random.

### 2. Click Counter

- A simple counter that increments when a button is clicked.
- Practiced basic state management and DOM updates.

### 3. Live Search Filter

- Implemented a real-time search filter on a list.
- Learned `input` event, `includes()`, and `style.display`.

### ðŸ’• 4. Todo List App

- Created, edited, deleted, and stored todos in localStorage.
- Practiced working with arrays, closures, and higher-order functions.

### 5. Dark Mode Toggle

- Toggled a `dark-mode` class on `<body>` to switch themes.
- Practiced using `classList.toggle()`.

### 6. Real-Time Clock

- Built a digital clock that updates every second using `setInterval`.
- Practiced `Date()` and `padStart()`.

### 7. Digital Calculator

- Implemented a simple calculator using `eval()`.
- Learned about handling input and safe evaluation.

### 8. Typing Speed Tester

- Compared user input to a sample sentence and calculated WPM.
- Timer and word count logic helped practice precision.

### ðŸ’• 9. Pomodoro Timer

- Built a full-featured timer with:
  - Focus/Break toggle
  - Progress bar
  - LocalStorage logging
  - Dark Mode
  - JSON Export & Import
  - Session log display with recent history

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- DOM manipulation, event listeners
- `setInterval`, `clearInterval`, and timers
- JSON and `localStorage`
- Async/await and API fetch handling
- Modular code structure with helper functions
- Data persistence and UI updates

_This week was a big leap in practical JavaScript. I now feel much more confident writing interactive web apps._
