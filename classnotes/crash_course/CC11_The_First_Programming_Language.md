# 🧠 The First Programming Languages

Crash Course Computer Science #11

## 💾 Software Evolution

Programming directly at the hardware level is **cumbersome and inflexible**, so programmers wanted a **more versatile** way to program computers.

### 🖥️ Machine Language (Machine Code)

- Computers can only understand **raw binary instructions**.
- In the early days of computing, people had to write entire programs **in machine code**.

### 🧾 Pseudo-code

- An **informal, high-level description** of a program, useful for planning logic before implementation.

### 🔤 Mnemonics & Assemblers

- Mnemonics were human-readable codes **attached to operands** (e.g., `ADD A, B`).
- **Assembler**: A program that reads text-based instructions and automatically converts them into the corresponding binary instructions.
  - This conversion is typically **1:1** (one mnemonic = one machine instruction).

### 👩‍🔧 Dr. Grace Hopper

- Harvard Mark I programmer.
- Created the first **compiler**: A-0 (Arithmetic Language Version 0) in **1952**.
- Her innovation led to **programs that could write other programs**.

### ✂️ Patched Code

- The term "patched" originates from physically placing paper **patches over holes** in punched tape to fix bugs.

### 🧮 Variables

- Variables eliminated the need to **manually remember which register** held which value.

## 🧪 Programming Languages

### 🧬 FORTRAN (Formula Translation)

- Developed by **IBM in 1957**.
- Its director once said he was **lazy enough to create a program that writes programs**.
- Optimized for **scientific and mathematical computation**.

### 🧾 COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language)

- Designed for **business applications**.
- Emphasized **"write once, run anywhere"** principles for portability.

## 📈 Impact of Programming Languages

- They **traded a small increase in computation time** for a **significant reduction in programming time**.
- Programming went from a **cumbersome, esoteric discipline** to an **accessible and general-purpose tool**.
- Higher abstraction levels enabled programmers to build **increasingly complex and powerful software**.
