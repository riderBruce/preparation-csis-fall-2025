### ☀️ Computer Science - Crash Course Episode 1

This week, I watched the first episode of CrashCourse Computer Science. It introduced the history of computing and how we arrived at today’s Electronic Age.

I learned that the **abacus**, one of the earliest calculating tools, was invented around 2500 BC in Mesopotamia. Over time, more complex tools were developed. Surprisingly, the word **"computer"** originally referred to a person who performed calculations by hand, not a machine.

Before the 20th century, people used **pre-computed tables** in the military to calculate artillery angles. However, these tables were not flexible for different cannon designs, which made people want machines that could adapt.

At the end of the 19th century, the U.S. Census Bureau requested a solution, and a **tabulating machine** was invented. The company that created it eventually became **IBM (International Business Machines)**.
