📘 Crash Course Computer Science #6: Registers and RAM – Summary

In this episode, we explore how computers store and retrieve information, focusing on registers and RAM (Random Access Memory).

⸻

🧠 Memory Basics
	•	The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) needs a place to store results — that’s where memory comes in.

✅ Latches
	•	AND-OR Latch: A circuit that stores 1 bit of information.
	•	Uses Set, Reset, AND, OR, and NOT gates.
	•	It’s called a “latch” because it holds on to a value.

✅ Gated Latch
	•	An improved latch that includes:
	•	Write Enable – controls when data can change.
	•	Data In and Data Out lines.
	•	Only updates data when Write Enable is active.

⸻

🏗️ Registers
	•	A register is a group of gated latches.
	•	Register width refers to how many bits it can store:
	•	8-bit register → stores 8 binary digits.
	•	Modern registers go up to 16, 32, 64 bits, etc.

⸻

🧮 Register Matrix Example
	•	A 256-bit register could be designed as a 16×16 matrix of latches.
	•	This structure reduces the number of control wires:
	•	1 wire for data, 1 for write enable, 1 for read enable, 16 for rows, 16 for columns.
	•	Controlled with an 8-bit address (4 bits for row + 4 bits for column).

⸻

🧠 RAM (Random Access Memory)
	•	Memory where each storage location can be randomly accessed.
	•	Modern RAM is made up of millions of tiny registers.

🟦 SRAM (Static RAM)
	•	Faster and more stable, but expensive.
	•	Often used in CPU caches.

🎯 Final Thought

Even though today’s computers are incredibly complex, they are built on simple logical structures like latches and registers — layers of abstraction stacked over time.
