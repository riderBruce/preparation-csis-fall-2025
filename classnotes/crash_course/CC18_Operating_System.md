# üìù Notes on CrashCourse Ep. 18 ‚Äì Operating Systems

Over time, CPUs became significantly faster than peripherals and human input. This created idle time, which led to the need for Operating Systems (OS) to manage the CPU efficiently.

Operating Systems provide essential features such as memory management, multitasking, memory protection, and I/O control.

Common OS examples include macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android.

**Batch Processing** was introduced to reduce CPU idle time by grouping jobs together and executing them as a batch.

**I/O (Input/Output)** refers to communication between the computer and external devices. The OS controls I/O through device drivers, which ensure compatibility with different hardware systems.

In 1962, the Atlas computer introduced the **Atlas Supervisor**, which supported scheduling and multitasking.

**Multitasking** allows multiple programs to run seemingly simultaneously by sharing CPU time.

Concepts like **virtual memory**, **dynamic memory allocation**, and **memory fragmentation** were introduced to improve memory efficiency.

The 1969 **Multics** project included these advanced memory features, but it was complex and used a large amount of memory. In contrast, **Unix** was simpler and became more widely adopted.

The **Unix kernel** manages I/O, memory, and multitasking. Other parts of the system consist of tools and libraries that extend functionality.

A **kernel panic** occurs when the operating system encounters a fatal error from which it cannot recover.

In personal computing, **MS-DOS** was released in 1981, and **Microsoft Windows** followed in 1985.
