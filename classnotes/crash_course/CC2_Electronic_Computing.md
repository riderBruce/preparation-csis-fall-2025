CrashCourse Computer Science #2

After the World Wars, the growing demands of population, warfare, and bureaucracy required machines that could process large amounts of data. This led to several key developments in computing hardware:

The first major advancement was the invention of **relays**, which operated electromechanically — switching on and off using a control wire, similar to how a faucet controls water. One early example was the **Harvard Mark I** in 1944, which used many relays. Interestingly, this machine attracted real insects, giving birth to the term **"bug"** in computing.

The next breakthrough was the **vacuum tube**. Unlike relays, vacuum tubes had no moving parts, making them purely electronic. This allowed for faster and more reliable machines. The **Colossus Mark I** (1943), built to break Nazi Enigma codes, was one of the first large-scale vacuum tube computers. Later, the **ENIAC** (1946) became the first general-purpose, programmable, electronic computer. It could perform more arithmetic than all humans combined up to that point — but it often overheated, working only half a day before tube failure.

Then came the **transistor**, a major leap in technology. It used solid-state materials (semiconductors) instead of mechanical parts, making it faster, smaller, and much more durable. Invented by **Bell Labs**, transistors replaced vacuum tubes and enabled the creation of compact, efficient computers. In 1957, IBM introduced a smaller and cheaper transistor-based computer.

Today’s computers use transistors smaller than **50 nanometers** — fast, energy-efficient, and long-lasting. Most of this development happened in **Santa Clara Valley, California**, which we now know as **Silicon Valley**.

## 📝 In Summary

> Modern computing evolved through three key stages — from **relays** ➝ to **vacuum tubes** ➝ to **transistors** — each step making computers smaller, faster, and more reliable.

## 🧠 Reflection

- This summary makes me feel like I'm already experiencing the kind of class I will take in the future.  
- I need to focus on the content and truly make it part of my own knowledge.  
- The lecture itself is great, but this whole process — watching, summarizing, reflecting — is a huge step for me.
