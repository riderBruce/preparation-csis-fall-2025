# The Central Processing Unit (CPU)
Crash Course #7 
In this episode, I explore how CPU was consisted, works and react with RAM.

## Overview
The **CPU's job** is to execute programs stored in **RAM**.

---

## Key Components and Concepts

- **Opcode**: Operation code, part of an instruction specifying the operation to perform.
- **Instruction Address Register**
- **Instruction Register**
- **Control Unit**
- **ALU** (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

---

## CPU Operation Cycle

- **Fetch - Decode - Execute**: The fundamental process cycle of the CPU.

---

## Timing and Speed

- **Clock**: Keeps the CPU ticking along.
- **Clock Speed**: The speed at which a CPU can carry out each step of the fetch-decode-execute cycle.
- **Hertz (Hz)**: Unit of frequency; one cycle per second.
- **Intel 4004**: A 4-bit CPU released in 1971, ran at 740 kHz.

---

## Performance Tweaks

- **Overclocking**: Modifying the clock to speed up the tempo of the CPU.
- **Underclocking**: Reducing the clock speed to save power.
- **Dynamic Frequency Scaling**: CPU adjusts its clock speed based on demand.

## CPU Chip Components

The CPU chip typically consists of:
- **Control Unit**
- **ALU**
- **Clock**
- **Registers**
