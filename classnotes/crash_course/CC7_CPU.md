# 🧠 The Central Processing Unit (CPU)  
*Crash Course Computer Science #7*

In this episode, we explore how the CPU is built, how it works, and how it interacts with RAM.

---

## 📌 Overview  
The **CPU's main job** is to execute programs that are stored in **RAM**.

---

## 🧩 Key Components and Concepts  

- **Opcode**: The part of a machine instruction that tells the CPU what to do.  
- **Instruction Address Register**: Holds the address of the current instruction.  
- **Instruction Register**: Stores the actual instruction being executed.  
- **Control Unit**: Directs the operation of the processor.  
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations.

---

## 🔁 CPU Operation Cycle  

- **Fetch → Decode → Execute**:  
  The CPU continually runs this cycle to process instructions.

---

## ⏱️ Timing and Speed  

- **Clock**: A signal that synchronizes the operation of CPU components.  
- **Clock Speed**: Determines how many cycles per second the CPU can perform.  
- **Hertz (Hz)**: Unit of measurement for clock speed.  
  - Example: The **Intel 4004**, released in 1971, was a 4-bit CPU running at **740 kHz**.

---

## ⚙️ Performance Tweaks  

- **Overclocking**: Increasing the clock speed to boost performance.  
- **Underclocking**: Reducing speed to save energy and reduce heat.  
- **Dynamic Frequency Scaling**: CPU automatically adjusts speed depending on workload.

## 🧠 What's Inside a CPU Chip?  

Typical internal components:
- **Control Unit**  
- **ALU**  
- **Clock**  
- **Registers**

## 📝 Reflection  
This episode helped me understand what actually happens inside the processor. The fetch-decode-execute cycle was especially helpful in seeing how all CPU instructions get handled.
